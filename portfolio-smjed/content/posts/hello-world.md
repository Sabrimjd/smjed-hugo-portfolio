Welcome to my blog! I'm a French systems engineer with a long-standing passion for systems, security, and networking that dates back to my younger years. What started as curiosity has evolved into a fulfilling career and continuous learning journey.

## About Me

I've built my career around understanding and implementing robust system architectures, but I believe there's always room to grow. Recently, I've been diving deeper into programming with a particular focus on Go and Python. Despite being what some might call a "late learner" in the programming world, I'm determined to master these skills to complement my systems expertise.

## What to Expect

This blog will serve as a chronicle of my experiences and projects. I plan to share:

- Technical tutorials and walkthroughs
- Insights from my professional journey
- Personal projects combining systems engineering and programming
- Lessons learned along the way

I believe in the power of sharing knowledge, and I hope that documenting my journey might help others with similar interests or career paths.

So here we go! The beginning of what I hope will be an insightful collection of posts for both myself and anyone who stumbles upon this corner of the internet.

Stay tuned for more!
